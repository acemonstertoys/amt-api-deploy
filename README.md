# What is this repo?

There is a dearth of documentation at AMT, but not all of the scripts and instructions are needed by all users. For example, the deployment of code should really only be done by qualified, trusted people. For that reason, we use this deployment repo to host versions of the configurations and processes (and their respective documents). This scheme allows us to reduce the complexity of parallel code repos, keep the configurations and documents versioned, and separate concerns.
